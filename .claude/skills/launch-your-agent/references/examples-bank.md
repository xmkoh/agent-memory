# Inspiration & example bank — Claude Managed Agents

> Reference points for the skill: official cookbooks to lift config patterns from, real production deployments to anchor "what good looks like," and officially-grounded archetypes to offer as opening examples in the interview.
> **Sourcing rule:** everything in §1–§3 traces to an official Anthropic source (cookbook, docs, or Claude/Anthropic blog). Our own unvalidated ideas live in §5 (backlog).
> Collected 2026-06-14. Live sources win over this file.

## How the skill uses this bank

- **In the opening (and any time during Q1):** offer the 2–3 closest archetypes (§3) as concrete examples of what an agent can be; if the founder wants a menu, AskUserQuestion with the closest few.
- **When emitting the build kit:** if the founder's problem rhymes with a cookbook (§1), lift its config shape (tools, resources, event flow) rather than inventing one — and put the cookbook link in NEXT-DIRECTIONS.md as their "go deeper" reading.
- **When a founder asks "is anyone actually doing this?":** the production stories (§2) are the answer.

## 1. Official Anthropic cookbooks (the canonical examples)

Repo: [anthropics/claude-cookbooks → managed_agents/](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks/tree/main/managed_agents) · rendered on [platform.claude.com/cookbook](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-iterate-fix-failing-tests). Python notebooks; include `utilities.py` (e.g. `stream_until_end_turn`), example data, and integration subfolders (slack/, sentry/, linear/, cma-mcp/, self_hosted_sandboxes/).

### Applied cookbooks (closest to "a founder's real agent")

| Cookbook | What it builds | Primitives it demonstrates | Good reference for |
|---|---|---|---|
| [data_analyst_agent](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-data-analyst-agent) | CSV in → narrative HTML report with charts (pandas/plotly) | Environment `packages`, file mounting, streaming, artifact retrieval | Any "analyze my data and report" agent |
| slack_data_bot | The analyst wrapped in a Slack bot; @mention with a CSV, replies continue the session | Sessions as conversations, their-app-as-interface, resuming sessions | Founders productizing an agent inside a chat surface |
| [sre_incident_responder](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-sre-incident-responder) | Pager alert → investigate → open PR → pause for human approval → merge | Event-triggered sessions (webhook), custom tools, human-in-the-loop gating, Skills | Ops/on-call agents; any "act, then wait for approval" flow |

### Guided tutorials (one primitive each, end-to-end)

| Tutorial | Teaches |
|---|---|
| [CMA_iterate_fix_failing_tests](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-iterate-fix-failing-tests) | **The entry point.** Agent/environment/session, file mounts, streaming event loop — via a do→observe→fix loop on a failing test suite |
| CMA_orchestrate_issue_to_pr | Multi-turn steering: issue → fix → PR → CI → review → merge, with mid-chain recovery |
| CMA_explore_unfamiliar_codebase | Grounding in a codebase; adding resources to a *running* session (`sessions.resources.add`) |
| CMA_gate_human_in_the_loop | Human-in-the-loop **expense approval** via custom tools (`decide()` / `escalate()`), the `requires_action` idle bounce |
| [CMA_prompt_versioning_and_rollback](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-prompt-versioning-and-rollback) | Agent versioning, regression detection, version pinning + rollback |
| [CMA_operate_in_production](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-operate-in-production) | MCP toolsets, vaults for per-end-user credentials, webhooks, resource lifecycle |
| [CMA_remember_user_preferences](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-remember-user-preferences) | Memory stores across sessions — customer preference learning and recall |
| [CMA_coordinate_specialist_team](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-coordinate-specialist-team) | Multiagent coordinator + three scoped specialists |
| [CMA_verify_with_outcome_grader](https://platform.claude.com/cookbook/managed-agents-cma-verify-with-outcome-grader) | Outcomes: the grade-and-revise loop (our default kickoff pattern) |

**Mapping to our interview:** Q2/Q2b ↔ verify_with_outcome_grader · Q3 credentials ↔ operate_in_production · Q5 event-driven ↔ sre_incident_responder · Q7 memory ↔ remember_user_preferences · Q8 multiagent ↔ coordinate_specialist_team · iteration/eval regression ↔ prompt_versioning_and_rollback.

### Worked examples inside the docs themselves

- **Financial analyst building a DCF model in .xlsx** — the running example of the [Outcomes page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/define-outcomes) (rubric-graded spreadsheet deliverable) and the [Skills page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/skills) (`xlsx` skill).
- **Weekly compliance scan** — the running example of the [Scheduled deployments page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/scheduled-deployments) (`0 20 * * 5`, America/New_York); the launch post also names **nightly data sync** and **daily digest** as the intended uses.
- **Coding assistant** — the quickstart's default agent (write code, run it, verify the output file).
- **Per-end-user agents with vaults** — the [Vaults page](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/managed-agents/vaults)'s "Alice's Slack digest" pattern: one vault per end user, `external_user_id` in metadata.

## 2. Real production deployments (proof points)

For "is anyone actually doing this?" — point at the customer stories in [the evolution of agentic surfaces](https://claude.com/blog/building-with-claude-managed-agents) and [Claude Managed Agents: get to production 10x faster](https://claude.com/blog/claude-managed-agents). The common thread (and the pitch to founders): the agent operates **inside the systems they already use** — codebase, wiki, ticketing, chat — and the managed harness removes the infra build entirely.

Also worth reading: [Scaling Managed Agents: decoupling the brain from the hands](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/managed-agents) (Anthropic engineering) — the architecture story (brain = model+harness, hands = sandbox, session = the persistent event log), useful framing language for explaining CMA to a founder in one breath.

## 3. Archetypes to offer (every one traces to an official source)

| # | Archetype | v0 (today) | Source | Natural next directions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Data analyst** | Hand it a CSV/export → narrative HTML report with charts: what's interesting, what changed. | data_analyst_agent cookbook | Weekly scheduled deployment against a fresh export; lives in Slack via the slack_data_bot pattern; their app embeds the report |
| 2 | **Ops responder with approval** | An alert/event → investigate → draft the fix or PR → stop and wait for human approval. | sre_incident_responder cookbook | Wire to their alerting webhook; custom tools into their backend; always_ask gates |
| 3 | **Document-producing analyst** | A research/finance task whose deliverable is a graded artifact — e.g. a DCF model in .xlsx judged against a rubric. | Outcomes + Skills docs (DCF example) | File-based rubrics; pptx/docx variants; recurring refresh on a deployment |
| 4 | **Engineering agent: issue → PR** | Take an issue, fix it, open the PR, recover when CI or review pushes back. | CMA_orchestrate_issue_to_pr + fix_failing_tests cookbooks | GitHub MCP + vault; triggered from their tracker; grounding pass on an unfamiliar repo first (explore_unfamiliar_codebase) |
| 5 | **Assistant that remembers your users** | A customer-facing helper whose memory store accumulates each user's preferences across sessions. | CMA_remember_user_preferences cookbook | One memory store + one vault per end user; Dreams to consolidate |
| 6 | **Recurring compliance / digest scan** | A scheduled sweep — weekly compliance scan, nightly data sync, daily digest — that runs and files its report without anyone present. | Scheduled-deployments docs + launch blog | Limited-networking allowlist; webhook notifications; outcome grading per run |
| 7 | **Specialist team** | A coordinator that delegates to a small roster of scoped specialists (research / review / write) working in parallel. | CMA_coordinate_specialist_team cookbook | Per-specialist models and tools; escalation tier on Opus |

Personalization rule: change only the name/company/product slots, one sentence of domain context, and the output format — the underlying config shape comes from the source cookbook/doc.
