# Mock connectors — design now, wire later

When the founder wants a connector (Slack, email, an issue tracker, their own backend, a brokerage) that can't be wired in this session — credential not on hand, OAuth too slow, or they just want to keep moving — don't drop the capability and don't pretend it exists. **Mock it, visibly**, so v0 already behaves as if the connector were there and the later version is a swap, not a redesign.

## Two mock styles

**1. Outbox mock — the default; works unattended and on deployments.**
The agent writes each would-be action as a JSON file to `/mnt/session/outputs/outbox/<seq>-<action>.json`, using the same payload shape the real call would take (schemas below). One line in the system prompt: *"You cannot send/post X directly yet. For each action you would take, write the exact payload to the outbox instead."* Add a rubric criterion that every outbox payload is complete and matches the schema. The founder can read the outbox like a queue of "what it would have done."
Swap to real (v1): add the MCP server to `mcp_servers` + a vault credential + an `always_ask` gate, remove the outbox instruction. The payloads the agent already produces map 1:1 onto the real tool's arguments.

**2. Custom-tool mock — when the founder wants to feel the interaction live.**
Define a `custom` tool on the agent with a realistic `input_schema` (below). The agent's calls surface as `requires_action`; answer them in-session with a stubbed `user.custom_tool_result` (e.g. `{"ok": true, "id": "mock_123"}`). Good for shaping tool-call behaviour while the founder watches; **not** suitable for unattended schedules — every call blocks until something answers it. Swap to real: replace the custom tool with the real `mcp_toolset` entry.

Either way: tell the founder which mock you used and why, and write the swap-to-real route into NEXT-DIRECTIONS (which MCP server, which vault credential type, which gate).

## Typical endpoint schemas

Use these as the outbox payload shape and/or the custom tool `input_schema`. Trimmed to the fields that matter; extend per the founder's real system.
